            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This windows forms application was a group project, with the objective being to create some sort of mock application for the 
                Rochester Institute of Technology. My group decided to create a food delivery application that allows students and staff to 
                order food delivery from off campus using their RIT TigerBucks. I worked with three other classmates, and my portion of this 
                project was to create the dropdown menu to select a resturant, and to create each individual resturant page. I also helped 
                to connect all the pages together with another teammate, which included passing in the global variables such as food items
                chosen and prices. 
            </p>

            <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            <p>This project was created with C# in Visual Studio 2017</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>One challenge I faced personally in my pages, specifically in the individual resturant menu pages, was how to store the 
                chosen items and their prices. Eventually, I wrote a function that took in a Button sender and then retrieved that button's 
                text (food item and it's price), split it at the line break into a temporary array of two items, then pushed the first item 
                into a list of strings (food item) and the second item into a list of doubles (prices). These two lists were also global and 
                were carried over to the checkout form. Also, a message box displays each time letting the user know the item was added to the 
                cart and once the cart is full the user is prompted to move to checkout.
