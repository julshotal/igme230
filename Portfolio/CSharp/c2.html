            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Using a binary tree, this program reads a text file containing base information and, depending on the user answering simple yes
                or no questions, will guess who the user is thinking of. If the program guesses correctly, it asks the user if they would like to
                play again. If the program guesses incorrectly, it will ask the user who they were thinking of and what seperates the two and asks
                if the user would like to play again. Once the user chooses to cease playing, the new information is written to the programs text file 
                for the next time the game is plated, thus the program "learns" the new information.
            </p>

            <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            <p>This project was created with C# in Visual Studio 2017</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>It was difficult using the FileIO StreamWriter to write all the new information to the program's text file, as each item
                in the text file has a "L" or "B" in front of it which denotes whether that item is a branch or leaf node. This was fixed
                by using a recursive function to check whether the item has children, and if it doesn't it's assigned "L" and if it does
                it's assigned "B".
            </p>
